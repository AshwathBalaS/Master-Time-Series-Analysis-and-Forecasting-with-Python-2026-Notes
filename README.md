# **B) Course Introduction**

I'm very happy that you picked this course to learn time series analysis.
It's the fifth year that this course has been live, and I truly think it's the most complete out there.

And there's absolutely no video that were in the, let’s say, first two editions that are currently live now.
So it’s currently always, always updating.

What I want to show you throughout this video is every single change since the 2025 version to now, the 2026 version.
This walkthrough will help you understand exactly what has improved and why it matters.

The key changes start with much crisper videos.
I really try to make sure that all videos are shorter and more focused.

We also now have deeper explanations and better explanations overall.
The goal is not just speed, but clarity.

Coding is now done with AI in, I think, most of the videos by now.
This allows us to spend more time looking at documentation and understanding what is what and why we are doing it, without the hassle of writing all the code manually.

Of course, we are very critical about it.
In the end, the code used is the one that I like, not necessarily the one that, in our case, Jamie and I are told to use.

We also add new projects and topics based on popular demand.
So the bottom line is, if you want something, tell me.

If there are a few people that want the same thing, I’ll make it happen.
And that’s a promise.

I also introduced an AI assistant.
You now have a time series analysis assistant that you can take anywhere with you and use in your job or during interviews.

This is a print screen of the assistant.
All the materials of the course are there—honestly, everything is there.

It’s just about asking the right questions.
And the assistant responds, I think, in my tone.

So if you like the way I talk or the way I use words, you’re going to like this as well.

Now, let’s look at what the course was in 2025.
At that time, we had five parts.

These were time series analysis, modern time series models and forecasting, deep learning for time series, and advanced content for time series.
We also had a Python appendix.

The Python appendix was for those who were not very familiar with Python but still wanted to learn.
There was a crash course at the end.

These were all the sections that were available back then.
I don’t want to spend too much time listing them, but they’re all there.

The question then becomes: what did we change?
This is where the remakes come in.

One important highlight is a new part called the Time Series Graveyard.
These are techniques that existed before but have not been updated by the teams maintaining them.

That’s why I’m calling it the graveyard.
This section also exists because of your requests.

In the past, I removed some sections.
Some people later asked if they could still access them.

So now, instead of removing them completely, they live in the Time Series Graveyard.
I wouldn’t advise you to focus on them, but it’s your choice.

This section includes everything that was either remade or added.
Anything marked as new represents a true addition.

We added new practice exercises for time series analysis.
We also added new intermittent forecasting and classification for time series.

For sections that are not marked as new, their Python tutorials were fully remade.
This was necessary because new changes in the libraries required updates.

As a result, the course is now 100% up to date.
Nothing is outdated or obsolete.

This is how the 2026 version of the course is now organized.
It consists of six parts.

These are time series analysis, modern time series, deep learning, advanced content, the graveyard, and the Python appendix.

The course is also now split between sections and projects or exercises.
Depending on your goals, you can choose how deep you want to go.

If you want structured learning, you can focus on the sections.
If you want to build a portfolio, you’ll find plenty of projects and exercises.

One important thing to note is that the course is actually shorter than it was one year ago.
This is despite having a lot of new content.

The reason is simple: the videos are crisper and better edited.
Using AI for coding also makes learning much faster.

This creates a smoother and more efficient learning experience.
That’s something I’m genuinely excited about.

The 2026 version is live.
So let’s get started.

# **C) Overview of the AI Time Series Assistant**

In the previous lecture, I gave you a link to the AI time series assistant, and in this video I want to give you a brief introduction to it. I’m going to call this version one of the assistant. I focused a lot on getting the core functionalities and the architecture right so that I can build on it later. There are quite a few things that could still be improved, and that’s exactly what I’m looking for when you share your feedback.

In this video, I want to introduce what it can do, what it cannot do, and the other actions available. It’s always going to be a time series course assistant, and it has a collapsible bar where you can see its capabilities, the core topics it covers, and also what it cannot do. For example, it cannot give medical advice, it cannot run code, and it cannot browse the web. You’ll also see a “ready to predict the future” message and some initial information explaining what it can and cannot do.

Let’s say we enter a message, for instance, “explain time series analysis,” and then click on send. You’ll notice that it shows when it’s thinking, both in the chat itself and at the top, where it indicates that it’s running. This assistant is going to complement the AI assistant from Udemy. There are a few things they have in common, especially when it comes to the videos themselves, because both have access to the transcripts. In fact, everything from the Udemy AI assistant comes from those transcripts, so if you want something specific to a given lecture, that’s where it’s useful.

For example, if you want a summary of a lecture, the Udemy assistant is very good because everything is directly linked to your current video. However, this time series assistant is not linked to your current video experience, so that’s one area where Udemy’s assistant is better. On the other hand, this assistant has some clear advantages. First, it’s always going to be up to date. For instance, we’re currently using GPT-5 already, whereas the Udemy assistant, based on things like its use of words such as “delve,” still feels very much like GPT-4.

At the same time, this assistant has all the course material loaded into it. That includes all the Python code, all the PDFs, and everything else from the course. So if you want something really tailored to the course—especially things you want to use, reuse, and take into your professional life—this is the one to use. It’s also not really tied to Udemy, which means you can keep it open and ask questions while you’re working on your own projects.

This tool is meant for you to use and reuse. Of course, there are many things that can still be improved. There’s an option to give feedback, and while I’d obviously love it if you love it, what I really care about is that you share what you like and what you would improve. This could be things like the colors, the layout, or any other aspect. Again, this is version one.

If you’ve been with the course for a long time—especially since the course originally dates back to 2021—you know that I’m always improving it. There will be a version two, version three, and so on, because I’m very focused on making this the best course possible.

While you’re here, you can also ask things like, “Give me the code for exponential smoothing,” press control-enter, and the assistant will think and respond. Alongside this, I want to emphasize that the feedback section is really important. Sometimes people ask for personal help through the feedback, but I can’t help you that way. If you need my help directly, you should always use the Q&A section. I answer questions there almost every day—there’s maybe one day a month when I don’t check it.

The Q&A is always the best way to reach out to me. I do gather feedback from this tool, but I don’t check feedback every day. I usually review it weekly or monthly, make sure everything is working, and then act on it after a couple of months to improve the tool. One example of feedback is that the Udemy assistant allows you to add images, which is really cool, whereas this one currently cannot. That’s something to keep in mind for future improvements.

You’ll also find all the code used in the course here. This is the same code we use throughout the course, and it should always be up to date because it reflects the latest course materials. If you ever find any issues, please let me know, because sometimes it can produce hallucinations, which I can’t fully control.

If at any point you don’t want to continue a conversation and you want to start fresh, you can reset the conversation. That will start a new session. Everything here is session-based only—there’s no database in the backend, and nothing is stored.

If this is something you love and use a lot, there’s an option to donate. This is completely optional, but I want to be transparent that this tool does cost money to run. The cost for one to ten people is basically nothing, but when you get to thousands of users, it becomes more significant. So if it genuinely makes a difference in your life, you can support it, but again, it’s absolutely optional.

At the end of the day, this is yours. Even if you hate me, you can bookmark it. There’s no login, and it’s an open tool that you can use and reuse. It’s here for you to keep. I personally find it very cool when people use my work, so if you do use it, let me know.

# **II) Section 2: Part 1 - Time Series Analysis**

# **A) Time Series Analysis Overview**

Welcome to the time series analysis part of the course. This is where you take your data skills to the next level, learning how to make your data work for you and predict future trends with accuracy. Let’s get started.

Have you ever wondered how companies like Amazon and Netflix always seem to know what’s coming next? It all comes down to mastering time series forecasting. By the end of this section, you’ll be applying the same techniques to your own business and career, turning raw data into accurate, actionable predictions.

We’ll begin by understanding what time series data is and why it plays such a critical role in forecasting. You’ll work with real-world data in Python and set up all the essential tools needed for time series analysis. This foundation will allow you to build robust models and generate precise predictions.

Before forecasting effectively, it’s essential to know your data inside out. You’ll perform exploratory data analysis to uncover hidden patterns and structures in your time series. Through visualization and data manipulation techniques, you’ll learn how to interpret your data and prepare it properly for forecasting.

You may notice that certain trends repeat over time—this is known as seasonality. You’ll learn how to decompose your data into seasonal, trend, and residual components. This breakdown will help you model your data more accurately and significantly improve your predictions.

Understanding how past data points influence future values is another key concept. You’ll explore autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to measure these relationships. This knowledge is essential for selecting, tuning, and validating your forecasting models.

Next, we’ll dive into a range of forecasting techniques. You’ll start with simple exponential smoothing, which works well for short-term predictions. From there, you’ll move on to the Holt-Winters method to handle seasonality. You’ll also work with more advanced models such as ARIMA and SARIMAX to capture complex patterns in time series data.

Imagine being able to predict stock prices or customer demand with confidence. You’ll develop these skills through hands-on exercises and real-world challenges. This section is not just about theory—it’s about applying these techniques to real data and understanding their results.

You’ll also explore what happens when forecasting goes wrong. By studying real case studies where predictions missed the mark, you’ll learn to recognize common pitfalls and improve your forecasting approach.

Finally, you’ll bring everything together in a capstone project focused on forecasting airline miles. You’ll prepare the data, build forecasting models, and evaluate their performance. By the end of this project, you’ll have a strong, practical example of your forecasting skills to showcase professionally.

You’re not just learning how to forecast—you’re mastering a powerful skill that can transform your career. See you in the next video.
